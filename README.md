Mobile App to detect road condition in Sri Lanka. While Google Maps recommend routes based on known road and traffic conditions, it is agnostic to condition of the road. Moreover, authoritties are unware of conditions of the rural roads to initiate repairs. Objective of this project is to develop a mobile app that can estimate the road condition based on a smartphone mounted on a vehicle such as a car & a 3-wheeler. Techniques/tools include GPS, Geo tagging, 3-axis accelerometers, Gyro, signal processing, etc.
